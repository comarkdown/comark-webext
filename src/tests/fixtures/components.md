Comark extends standard Markdown with component syntax, letting you embed custom UI directly in your content while keeping it readable. Parsing is provided by the built-in [`components` plugin](/plugins/defaults/components) (enabled by default).

::callout
Comark also supports JSON-render syntax in code blocks — see the [json-render plugin](/plugins/built-in/json-render).
::

## Block

Block components use the `::component-name` syntax and occupy their own line:

```mdc
::component-name{prop1="value1" prop2="value2"}
Content inside the component

Can have **markdown** and other elements
::
```

Here are some examples of block components:

::code-group
```mdc [Alert]
::alert{type="info"}
This is an important message!
::
```

```mdc [Card]
::card{title="My Card"}
Card content with **markdown** support
::
```

```mdc [Empty]
::divider
::
```
::

## Inline

Inline components use the `:component-name` syntax and can be placed within text:

```mdc
Check out this :icon-star component in the middle of text.

Click the :button[Submit]{type="primary"} to continue.

The status is :badge[Active]{color="green"} right now.
```

| Syntax                        | Description                                  |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `:icon-check`                 | Standalone inline component                  |
| `:badge[New]`                 | Inline component with content                |
| `:badge[New]{color="blue"}`   | Inline component with content and properties |
| `:tooltip{text="Hover text"}` | Inline component with properties only        |

## Properties

Components support two property syntaxes: inline attributes and YAML frontmatter.

### Inline Attributes

Use the `{...}` syntax for simple properties:

```mdc
::component{prop="value"}
<!-- Standard key-value pair -->
::

::component{bool}
<!-- Boolean property (becomes :bool="true" in AST) -->
::

::component{#custom-id}
<!-- ID attribute -->
::

::component{.class-name}
<!-- CSS class -->
::

::component{.class-one .class-two}
<!-- Multiple CSS classes -->
::

::component{obj='{"key": "value"}'}
<!-- Object/JSON value -->
::

::component{multiple="props" bool #id .class}
<!-- Multiple properties combined -->
::
```

### Block Props

For components with many properties, use YAML block syntax inside the component. Two styles are supported:

::code-group
~~~mdc [Codeblock Style]
::component
```yaml [props]
title: My Component
type: info
count: 42
enabled: true
items:
  - First item
  - Second item
config:
  theme: dark
  mode: auto
```
Component content goes here

With full **markdown** support
::
~~~

```mdc [Frontmatter Style]
::component
---
title: My Component
type: info
count: 42
enabled: true
items:
  - First item
  - Second item
config:
  theme: dark
  mode: auto
---
Component content goes here

With full **markdown** support
::
```
::

::callout{color="info" icon="i-lucide-info"}
Objects remain objects, arrays remain arrays, and numbers/booleans are parsed as their respective types rather than strings. Your components receive fully typed props.
::

#### Key Rules

- Must be at the very beginning of the component content
- Enclosed by `---` delimiters (frontmatter style) or `` ```yaml [props] `` fences (codeblock style)
- Merged with inline attributes (inline attributes take precedence)
- Full support for complex data structures

::tip
The default style can be configured with the [`blockAttributesStyle`](/api/render#options) option.
::

### Combine Both Syntaxes

Inline attributes and YAML props can be combined. Inline attributes take precedence:

~~~mdc
::card{.featured}
```yaml [props]
title: Featured Article
author: Jane Doe
tags:
  - markdown
  - documentation
```
This combines inline class `.featured` with YAML props
::
~~~

### Use Cases

**Configuration-heavy components:**

~~~mdc
::data-table
```yaml [props]
columns:
  - name: Name
    field: name
    sortable: true
  - name: Email
    field: email
    sortable: true
options:
  striped: true
  pageSize: 10
```
::
~~~

**API documentation:**

~~~mdc
::api-endpoint
```yaml [props]
method: POST
path: /api/users
parameters:
  - name: username
    type: string
    required: true
  - name: email
    type: string
    required: true
response:
  status: 201
  body:
    id: string
    username: string
```
::

## Data Binding

Props prefixed with `:` are JSON-parsed at render time. When the value isn't valid JSON, the renderer looks it up as a dot-path against an ambient **render context**, letting authors reference runtime data, frontmatter, meta, or the enclosing component's props without hardcoding them.

### Scope

The render context exposes four namespaces:

| Namespace     | Source                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontmatter` | The document's YAML frontmatter                      |
| `meta`        | Plugin-populated metadata on the parsed tree          |
| `data`        | Runtime values passed via the renderer's `data` prop |
| `props`       | The enclosing component's own props                  |

### Frontmatter

Reference any value declared in the document's frontmatter:

```mdc
---
theAnswer: 42
user:
  name: Ada
---

::question{:answer="frontmatter.theAnswer"}
::

Hello, :badge{:label="frontmatter.user.name"}
```

### Runtime data

Pass values from your app via the renderer's `data` prop and reference them under the `data.` namespace:

::code-group
```vue [Vue]
<Markdown :value="content" :data="{ user: { name: 'Ada' } }" />
```

```tsx [React]
<Markdown value={content} data={{ user: { name: 'Ada' } }} />
```

```svelte [Svelte]
<Markdown value={content} data={{ user: { name: 'Ada' } }} />
```

```typescript [Angular]
<comark-markdown [value]="content" [data]="{ user: { name: 'Ada' } }" />
```
::

```mdc
Welcome, :badge{:label="data.user.name"}!
```

### Parent component props

Nested components can read the enclosing component's resolved props through the `props.` namespace. This is useful when a child should mirror something declared once on its parent:

```mdc
::card{title="Hello" variant="primary"}
  :::badge{:color="props.variant" :text="props.title"}
  :::
::
```

### Resolution rules

- If the `:prefixed` value is a valid JSON literal (e.g. `5`, `true`, `"foo"`, `{"a":1}`), it's used as-is.
- Otherwise, the value is treated as a dot-path and resolved against `{ frontmatter, meta, data, props }`.
- Unknown paths resolve to `undefined`: the prop is passed as `undefined` rather than the raw string.
- Only props authored with the `:` prefix participate in data binding. Plain `prop="value"` attributes are always passed as literal strings.

::callout{color="info" icon="i-lucide-replace"}
Need to interpolate a value directly into text rather than a prop? The [Binding plugin](/plugins/built-in/binding) adds a `{{ path || default }}` inline shorthand that resolves against the same render context.
::

## Slots

Block components support slots for passing structured content to components.

### Default Slot

Content placed directly inside a component goes to the default slot, no prefix needed:

```mdc
::alert{type="info"}
This content goes to the default slot.
::
```

You can also write `#default` explicitly, which is useful when mixing it with named slots:

```mdc
::card
#default
This is the **default** slot content.

#footer
Footer content here.
::
```

### Named Slots

```mdc
::card
#header
## Card Title

#content
This is the main content of the card

#footer
Footer text here
::
```

### Combine with props

You can use both YAML block props and named slots in the same component:

~~~mdc
::card{.featured}
```yaml [props]
variant: elevated
color: primary
actions:
  - label: Read More
    url: /article
  - label: Share
    icon: share
```
#header
## Article Title
*By Jane Doe*

#content
This is the main article content with **markdown** support.

#footer
Published on January 15, 2024
::
~~~

::callout{color="warning" icon="i-lucide-triangle-alert"}
YAML block props must come immediately after the opening `::component` line, **before** any slot definitions.
::

**Correct order:**

~~~mdc
::component{inline-attrs}
```yaml [props]
yaml: props
```
#slot-name
Slot content
::
~~~

**Incorrect order:**

~~~mdc
::component
#slot-name
Slot content
```yaml [props]
yaml: props  <!-- This won't work -->
```
::
~~~

## Nested

Components can be nested within each other using additional colons:

```mdc
::outer-component
Content in outer

:::inner-component{variant="compact"}
Content in inner
:::

More content in outer
::
```

**Deep nesting:**

```mdc
::level-1
  :::level-2
    ::::level-3
    Content
    ::::
  :::
::
```

::callout{color="info" icon="i-lucide-info"}
Adding extra colons is not required but is a good practice to keep nesting visually consistent. The parser resolves nesting by matching opening and closing tags.
::

This also works:

```mdc
::level-1
  ::level-2
    ::level-3
    Content
    ::
  ::
::
```
